# MeteorCode
CodeTest

This is my first attempt on Meteor app. Took a while to figure out the testing part.
Configuration for the development phase is straight forward.
I took approximately 3 hours including practise from tutroial 
On windows, it was tricky to figure out command prompt must be run in administrator mode to run mocha testing.

Thank you,
